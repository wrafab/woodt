  <h1> Garment, Sublimation, UV Printing </h1>
  <br>
  <P>  I started off week 3, by completing a t-shirt design. I completed this using corell draw. I gathered pictures off the iternet and put them on my design. I downloaded them as JPG files snd then pressed the print button and set the printer to Garment-361. I plugged it into the t-shirt printer. Print Data Load --> my file, and then proceeded to print. I cannot upload my t-shirt file because Github says its too big. I also created a puzzle. I got the puzzle outline from the class website and uploaded the picture as a JPG. I plugged tyhe USB into the UV Printer Computer, I then set the dimensions of the puzzle on the printer. I then printed it off on the UV Printer. Lastly, I created a tie through sublimation. I downloaded in image off the internet and printed it off. I then put the solid image on the tie. I heated up the tie and the image and then and the image heated up and turned to liquid. It then printed off the image onto the tie and that allowed for the image to print off onto the tie.  </p>
