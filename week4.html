  <h1>3D Laser Cutting and Engraving </h1>
  <br>
  <P> In week 4 I made puzzle shapes. I started by creating shapes, and then I created some small hitches so that I could combine my pieces. I then set my images as "hairline", so the laser would go through the cardboard, and not just engrave it. I then saved my shapes file as a cdr file on the USB. I then plugged the USB into the laser printer computer and uploaded my file. I then set the rastor and vestor settings for card board. Then, I decided to engrave a bookmark. I started off by grabbing this goofy image of the internbet and saved it as JPG to my youdrive. I uploaded the image to corell draw and set the background image as the same length and height as the bookmark. I then set the rastor and vestor settings for the bookmark's material and printed. I then created my clock. I did this by setting my dimmensions for my clock. I then got Baker Mayfield's logo online and downloaded it and uploaded it to corell draw. I set everything as a hairline. I then uploaded a nike image so that it would engrave it. I then downloaded it as a cdr to the USB, amd set the rastor and vestor settings for the 1/8 wood and cut it. I then spray painted my clock orange, and then cut out brown, white, and orange vinyl stickers, and put it on the back of my clock. Lastly, I added the hands to my clock.
