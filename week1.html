<h1> Week 1 </h1>
<p> I started off week 1, by completing a couple design challenges with my friends Lee and Sammy. We wom the first challenge where we had to create a structure to stop the golf ball from touching the ground. We also won the second challenge where we had to create the tallest free-standing skyscraper out of newspaper. Later in the week we moved from design challemges, to coding. We learned how to create our website on GitHub, using html. I created my index page in class, as well as my about me page, and week 1 page. I'm having a lot of fun in this class and looking forward to the rest of the year, and trying to absorb as much as possible. </p>
